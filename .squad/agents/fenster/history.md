# Project Context

- **Owner:** Shari Paltrowitz
- **Project:** EatDiscounted — a Next.js web app that checks 8 dining discount platforms for any restaurant name. Results stream via SSE. Also has a Python CLI.
- **Stack:** Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, better-sqlite3, SSE streaming, Python CLI
- **Created:** 2026-04-30

## Session: 2026-04-30 — Ship-Readiness Evaluation

**Role:** Backend Dev — Backend reliability & API review  
**Participants:** Keaton, Hockney, Fenster, McManus  
**Outcome:** 🔴 Not ship-ready — three critical fixes required before launch

**Backend audit findings:**
- API design (SSE) is clean but not actually streaming: all results in burst despite SSE complexity
- **Google CSE dependency:** 100 free queries/day = ~14 user searches before quota exhaustion (hard ceiling)
- **Rate limiting:** 🔴 Zero actual rate limiting; RATE_LIMIT_DELAY constant is dead code
- **Error handling:** Backend is solid with timeouts and graceful failures; good input validation
- **Database:** WAL mode, UNIQUE constraints, parameterized queries ✅; but hot-reload fragility + SQLite on serverless blocker
- **Scalability:** No caching, no CDN, single-writer SQLite limitation; memory issue with large Blackbird sitemap
- **Secrets:** 🔴 `.env.local` NOT in `.gitignore` (credential leak risk); hardcoded salt in db.ts

**Three highest-leverage fixes:**
1. **Response caching** — cache Google CSE results by query for 1 hour (multiplies effective capacity 10-50x)
2. **Rate limiting** — 5 req/IP/min on `/api/check` (prevents quota death to first bot)
3. **Fix `.env.local` in `.gitignore` & rotate API key** — check git history for exposure

**Post-launch:** Blackbird sitemap caching, structured logging, proper XML parser, deployment platform decision.
